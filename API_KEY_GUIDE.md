# API Keys: Quick Guide

## Important: Your Claude.ai Subscription vs API Access

**Your Claude.ai subscription does NOT include API access.**

- **claude.ai subscription** = Web/app interface access (what you're using to chat with me now)
- **API access** = Separate service for developers to integrate Claude into their own apps

## Getting an API Key (Two Options)

### Option 1: Claude API (Recommended for you)

**You need a separate Anthropic API account:**

1. Go to: https://console.anthropic.com/
2. Sign up (can use same email as claude.ai, but it's a separate account)
3. Go to "API Keys" in the menu
4. Click "Create Key"
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-ant-`)

**Pricing:**
- Pay-as-you-go (no subscription needed)
- Very cheap for personal use: ~$0.003 per message
- You add credits (minimum $5)
- Example: $5 could last you months for this app

**Free tier:**
- Anthropic sometimes offers free trial credits
- Check the console for current promotions

### Option 2: OpenAI API (ChatGPT)

1. Go to: https://platform.openai.com/
2. Sign up
3. Add payment method
4. Go to API Keys → Create new key
5. Copy the key (starts with `sk-`)

**Pricing:**
- Similar pay-as-you-go model
- GPT-4: ~$0.03 per message
- GPT-3.5: ~$0.002 per message

## Which Should You Choose?

**Go with Claude API because:**
- You're already familiar with Claude's style
- Cheaper than GPT-4
- Better at conversational, supportive responses
- The system prompt I wrote is optimized for Claude

## Still Want to Use It Without API?

Unfortunately, there's no way around needing an API key for this local app. The alternatives would be:

1. **Simplified version**: I could build a version that works without AI, but you'd lose the conversational intelligence and automatic macro parsing

2. **Use claude.ai directly**: You could just chat with me here for accountability, but you'd lose the automated tracking interface

3. **Wait for local AI**: Could build a version that runs a local LLM, but that's more complex to set up

## My Recommendation

**Try the Claude API with $5 credit:**
- It's genuinely cheap for personal use
- You'll probably spend $0.50-1.00 per month
- You get the full conversational intelligence
- Worth it for the value you'll get

Think of it as less than a coffee per month for a personal AI health coach!
