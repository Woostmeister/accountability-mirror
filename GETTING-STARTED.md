## Tips for Best Results

### Medication Safety
- Always fill in "Current Medications" in Settings
- The AI will check supplement interactions
- Especially important if taking Tamoxifen or other medications

### Weekly Tracking
- Don't stress about daily "fails"
- Check your weekly totals - that's what matters
- A big day followed by a small day = balanced week

### Use One Main Browser
- Pick one browser/device as your "main" tracker
- Keeps your weekly data consistent
- Makes tracking easier
